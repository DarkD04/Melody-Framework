# Melody Framework
This is a Sonic framework made for Godot 4.3, lots of stuff is heavily based on my previous framework made for GameMaker Studio 2 [Harmony Framework](https://github.com/DarkD04/Harmony-Framework)

# Important!
This framework will never be finished and i don't suggest you use this if you have no experience with godot. I highly suggest you use this for nothing more than for studying or wait until chopp finishes GDSonic Framework. Most of the stuff from this framework is being added to GDSonic Framework!

# Required tools
- Godot 4.3
- Aseprite [Used by the sprite importer plugin]

# Credits
- Darkn
- Chopp
