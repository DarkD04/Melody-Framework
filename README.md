# Melody Framework
This is a Sonic framework made for Godot 4.3, lots of stuff is heavily based on my previous framework made for GameMaker Studio 2 [Harmony Framework](https://github.com/DarkD04/Harmony-Framework)

# Features of the framework
- Basic 360 movement with 6 sensor setup based on [Sonic Physics Guide](https://info.sonicretro.org/Sonic_Physics_Guide)
- Basic player states and controller
- Loops and path swappers

# Important!
This framework will never be finished and i don't suggest you use this if you have no experience with godot. I highly suggest you use this for nothing more than for studying or wait until chopp finishes GDSonic Framework. Most of the stuff from this framework is being added to GDSonic Framework! Would also like to note that the codebase hasn't been cleaned up.

# Required tools
- Godot 4.3
- Aseprite [Used by the sprite importer plugin]

# Credits
- Darkn
- Chopp
